This is another Bash script that executes OpenOCD (Open On-Chip Debugger) for interacting with a microcontroller. In this case, it's set up for an STM32G4 series microcontroller using an ST-Link interface. The script is configured to initialize the debugger and reset the microcontroller with specific settings, and it also accepts additional command-line arguments.

### Breakdown of the Script:

1. **OpenOCD Command**:
   - `openocd`: This is the command to start OpenOCD, a tool used for debugging and programming microcontrollers.

2. **Configuration Files**:
   - `-f interface/stlink.cfg`: Specifies the configuration file for the ST-Link interface, a common debugger and programmer for STM and ST microcontrollers.
   - `-f target/stm32g4x.cfg`: Indicates the configuration file for the STM32G4 series microcontroller, detailing specific settings for this family of microcontrollers.

3. **OpenOCD Commands**:
   - `-c init`: Initializes OpenOCD.
   - `-c "reset_config none separate; reset init"`: A combination of commands to configure and execute a reset. `reset_config none separate` configures the reset behavior, where `none` specifies no specific reset type and `separate` means the debug and target resets are handled independently. `reset init` then initializes the reset process.

4. **Additional Arguments** (`$@`):
   - `$@`: This Bash special parameter represents all the arguments supplied to the script. This allows the user to include any additional OpenOCD commands or parameters.

### Purpose of the Script:

- The script sets up OpenOCD to communicate with an STM32G4 microcontroller using an ST-Link interface. It's configured to initialize and reset the microcontroller in a specific way.
- The inclusion of `$@` for additional arguments provides flexibility, letting users pass other commands or settings as required for their debugging or programming tasks.

### Usage:

To use this script:
1. Ensure OpenOCD and the necessary drivers for ST-Link are installed on your system.
2. Connect the ST-Link debugger to the STM32G4 microcontroller.
3. Execute the script in a Bash shell, adding any extra OpenOCD commands or parameters you need.

This script is useful for embedded software developers and hardware engineers for activities like programming, debugging, or interacting with STM32G4 microcontrollers in various development scenarios.
