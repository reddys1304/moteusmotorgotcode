This header file defines the `FirmwareInfo` class within the `moteus` namespace, a part of a larger project likely focused on embedded systems or robotics. The class is designed to provide information about the firmware running on a device.

### Class Overview:

#### `FirmwareInfo` Class:
- **Purpose**: To store and provide access to firmware-related information like version, model number, and serial number.
- **Constructor**: Accepts a memory pool (`mjlib::micro::Pool`), a telemetry manager (`mjlib::micro::TelemetryManager`), a firmware version, and a model number. These dependencies suggest that the class may be part of a larger system where memory management and telemetry are important concerns.
- **Destructor**: Defined but the implementation details are not provided in the header file.

#### Methods:
- `model_number`: Returns the model number of the device.
- `firmware_version`: Returns the firmware version encoded in a specific format (major.minor.micro).
- `serial_number`: Returns the unique serial number of the device, structured as an array of three `uint32_t` numbers.

#### Inner Struct:
- `SerialNumber`: A structure to hold the serial number, consisting of an array of three `uint32_t` elements.

#### Private Members:
- `impl_`: A pointer to the implementation class `Impl`, following the Pimpl (Pointer to Implementation) idiom. This suggests that the details of the `FirmwareInfo` class are hidden from the user, providing an abstraction layer and potentially easing maintenance and compatibility.

### Key Features:

- **Firmware Identification**: The class provides mechanisms to identify firmware by version and model number, crucial for compatibility checks, updates, and troubleshooting.
- **Unique Device Identification**: Offers a method to retrieve a unique serial number, aiding in device tracking and management.
- **Abstraction and Encapsulation**: Adheres to the Pimpl idiom, hiding implementation details and exposing only the necessary interface to the user. This reduces coupling and can improve compile times.

### Usage:

The `FirmwareInfo` class is likely used in embedded systems or devices where firmware plays a critical role. It can be utilized for:
- Displaying firmware details to the user or system administrator.
- Performing firmware compatibility checks during updates or maintenance.
- Logging and telemetry, where details about the deviceâ€™s firmware are essential.
- Unique identification of devices in a network or system.

### Conclusion:

The `FirmwareInfo` class is a well-structured component that provides essential information about a device's firmware in an embedded system or similar application. Its design reflects good software engineering practices, offering a clean and easy-to-use interface for accessing firmware-related data while keeping implementation details hidden and separated.
