#if defined(TARGET_STM32G4)
#include "stm32g4xx.h"
#else
#error "Unknown target"
#endif


This code snippet is a simple header file that appears to be part of a larger project targeting STM32G4 series microcontrollers. The purpose of this file is to include the appropriate device header file for the STM32G4 family. 

### Explanation of the Code:

- **Conditional Compilation (`#if` directive):**
  - The `#if defined(TARGET_STM32G4)` directive checks if the `TARGET_STM32G4` macro is defined. This is typically set in the build environment or in other parts of the code to indicate that the target microcontroller is from the STM32G4 series.
  
- **Header File Inclusion:**
  - If `TARGET_STM32G4` is defined, `stm32g4xx.h` is included. This header file contains all the standard peripheral library definitions for STM32G4 series microcontrollers, as provided by STMicroelectronics in their HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) library.
  
- **Error Directive:**
  - The `#else #error` block produces a compilation error if `TARGET_STM32G4` is not defined. It's a safeguard to ensure that the code is being compiled for the correct target.

### Usage:

This header file is likely used in a larger project that is meant to be compiled for the STM32G4 series microcontrollers. It ensures that the correct device-specific headers are included, which is crucial for accessing the microcontroller's peripherals, such as GPIOs, ADCs, timers, and other hardware features.

### Example Scenario:

In a project for the STM32G4 microcontroller:

1. The build system (like Makefile or CMake) defines `TARGET_STM32G4`.
2. This header file is included in the source files.
3. The appropriate device header (`stm32g4xx.h`) is included based on the defined target.
4. The rest of the code can use the definitions and declarations from `stm32g4xx.h` to interact with the hardware peripherals of the STM32G4 microcontroller.

This kind of conditional inclusion is common in embedded software development where the code might be designed to be portable across different microcontroller families or variants within a family.
