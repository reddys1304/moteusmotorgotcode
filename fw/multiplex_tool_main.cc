This code snippet is the main entry point for a C++ program that utilizes the Boost.Asio library and the `mjlib` multiplexing tool. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

### Includes and Main Function:
1. **Boost.Asio's `io_context`**: The `boost::asio::io_context` class from the Boost.Asio library provides core synchronous and asynchronous I/O functionality. It's a central object that manages all I/O services.

2. **Multiplex Tool**: The `mjlib::multiplex::multiplex_tool` is likely a custom tool or library, part of the `mjlib` namespace. This tool appears to handle multiplexing tasks, which may involve managing multiple communication channels or data streams.

3. **Main Function**: The `main` function is the standard entry point for a C++ program. It takes command line arguments `argc` (argument count) and `argv` (argument vector - an array of character strings representing the arguments).

### Program Flow:
1. **Create `io_context`**: An instance of `boost::asio::io_context` is created. This object will handle I/O events and execute asynchronous tasks.

2. **Multiplex Tool Execution**: The `mjlib::multiplex::multiplex_main` function is called with the `io_context`, `argc`, and `argv` as arguments. This suggests that the main functionality of the program is handled by this function, possibly involving I/O multiplexing tasks.

3. **Return Value**: The program returns the value from `mjlib::multiplex::multiplex_main`, which likely indicates the success or failure of the program's execution.

### Usage and Context:
- The program is designed to perform tasks related to I/O multiplexing, possibly in a networked or communication-heavy environment, where handling multiple I/O streams efficiently is crucial.

- Boost.Asio is widely used for network programming due to its support for asynchronous I/O, making it a good choice for applications that require high-performance networking or I/O operations.

- The use of `mjlib` suggests that this program is part of a larger project or system that has custom libraries for handling specific tasks.

This code is a basic setup and primarily serves as a starting point. The actual functionality will depend on the implementation of `mjlib::multiplex::multiplex_main` and how it utilizes the `io_context`.
#include <boost/asio/io_context.hpp>

#include "mjlib/multiplex/multiplex_tool.h"

extern "C" {
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  boost::asio::io_context context;
  return mjlib::multiplex::multiplex_main(context, argc, argv);
}
}
